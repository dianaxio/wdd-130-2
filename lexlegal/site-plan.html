        The career began to develop in the late 1960s when law firms and individual practitioners sought ways to improve legal services' efficient and cost-effective delivery. Utilization of legal assistants in a law firm ultimately reduces the cost to the client and frees time for lawyers.

        Legal assistants are qualified by education, training, or work experience and are employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency, or other entity to perform specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible.  In a law firm setting, assistant legals time spent on substantive legal work is billed to clients at market rates, similar to other professional staff, but at a lower rate.  This distinguishes legal assistants from other non-lawyer staff members.
