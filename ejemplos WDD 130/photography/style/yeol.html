      <h3>What you can do here on SU COOK</h3>
      <p>
        Since my website has a lot of unique recipes that were explained simpler and easier than any other site. However, the quality and taste would be greater than others at the same time. My website also provides recipes for Korean food. It is very unique so I can take their attention to my website instead of othersâ€™.<br><br>
        They can request me a recipe for the dishes they want to cook as long as I know of it. They can ask me what they can add, remove, or substitute from the recipes according to what they have at their place.
